- Browse categories on the homepage (mortgage, investments, budgetingâ€¦) â€” more tools are being added weekly.

## Whatâ€™s coming
- Interlinked **FAQs** on each calculator
- **Daily (EOD)** price snapshots and a simple market ticker

- A growing **resources** library (guides and checklists)

## Our promise
